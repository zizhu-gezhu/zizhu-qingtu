## Highlights

- Import, convert, optimise, and proportionally resize JPEG / JFIF, PNG, WebP, and GIF files
- Automatically compare candidate formats and choose a smaller result with limited visual loss
- Before/after preview, actual output size, continuous quality and scale controls, and text watermarks
- Limit output to 200 KB, 100 KB, 50 KB, or a custom size using measured quality and dimension adjustments
- Import an entire folder recursively; large batches use the same low-memory queue
- Clipboard monitoring, global shortcuts, watched folders, and a local result library
- Clop-inspired floating results with copy, preview, undo, further downscaling, and format switching, plus clear success or failure feedback in the lower-left status area
- Configurable result limit, stacked/list layouts, and automatic dismissal
- Optionally exclude floating results from system screenshots and recordings on macOS and Windows; third-party capture tools may choose not to honor OS protection
- Replace, rename beside the source, or export to a fixed folder with scheduled cleanup
- Upload to WebDAV, S3/R2, OSS, FTP, or SFTP image hosts
- Built-in batch rename, format conversion, and resize/enlarge plugins, plus local HTML/JavaScript and URL workbench plugins
- Tauri 2 + Rust desktop apps; images stay on your device by default

### Built-in plugin: Batch rename

Batch rename lives on its own plugin page. It extracts regex captures from ancestor folders at any depth, supports zero-padding and templates, and previews conflicts before applying changes. Custom rules can be saved, updated, and restored as the last-used rule. Folder monitoring can reuse the same parent-folder naming rules.

### Built-in plugins: Convert and resize

The converter batches JPEG, WebP, or PNG output with the same high-quality, balanced, smaller, and manual modes as the workbench. The resize plugin uses SIMD-accelerated Lanczos3 scaling for percentages, a fixed width or height, bounding boxes, and exact dimensions. Either plugin can copy its settings into a new watched-folder task.

### Floating-window workflow

The desktop app can open its floating window from a global shortcut, copied image, dropped file, or the local image picker, without opening the full workbench first. Smart compression can stay enabled for every imported image, or you can switch to your custom compression settings from the floating window footer. Hover over the preview to copy, preview, reveal, undo, downscale again, switch formats, add a watermark, or upload. Floating results are draggable and resizable, support cycling stacks and expanded lists, result limits and automatic dismissal, and let you choose up to six action buttons in Settings.

### Multi-task folder monitoring

Add and save tasks directly on the Folder Monitor page. Independent folders such as A, B, and C can run at the same time, each with its own format, quality, scale, dimensions, output location, naming rule, completion notification, and floating-result preference. Tasks take effect immediately and are restored after restart; ZizhuQingTu must remain running, though it can be minimised to the tray.

## Download

Get the latest installers from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zizhu-gezhu/zizhu-qingtu/releases):

- Windows x64 / ARM64: `.exe`, `.msi`, or portable `.zip`
- macOS Apple Silicon / Intel: `.dmg`
- Linux x64 / ARM64: `.AppImage` or `.deb`

The current macOS builds use ad-hoc signing. On first launch, macOS may require approval in System Settings → Privacy & Security.

## Web and Docker

The web build is a static, install-free version. Images are processed locally in your browser and are not uploaded to a server. Use the desktop app for the system tray, global shortcuts, persistent clipboard monitoring, and watched folders.

For a LAN deployment, custom domain, or your own service endpoint, use the container image. The default service port is `3456`.

### Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zizhu-gezhu/zizhu-qingtu.git
cd zizhu-qingtu
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Upgrade, inspect status, and follow logs:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f zizhu-qingtu
```

Create a `.env` file in the project directory to change the bind address, host port, or image tag:

```dotenv
ZIZHU_QINGTU_BIND=0.0.0.0
ZIZHU_QINGTU_PORT=3456
ZIZHU_QINGTU_TAG=1.0.0
```

To build from the current source tree instead:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up -d --build
```

### Docker Run

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name zizhu-qingtu \
  -p 3456:3456 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/zizhu-gezhu/zizhu-qingtu:latest
```

Open `http://SERVER_IP:3456`. The web build includes the compression workspace; browser security restrictions prevent system-tray, global-shortcut, and persistent folder-monitoring features.

For a reverse proxy, forward your domain to `http://127.0.0.1:3456`. Caddy example:

```caddyfile
zizhu-qingtu.example.com {
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3456
}
```

## Development

Requires Node.js 22.13+, stable Rust, and the Tauri 2 system dependencies for your target platform.

> Windows extras:
> 1. **MSVC Build Tools** (with the “Desktop development with C++” workload) and **Rust** (`rustup`);
> 2. **Strawberry Perl** — the `ssh2` crate enables `vendored-openssl`, and building OpenSSL needs a full Perl; Git's bundled Perl lacks required modules;
> 3. ⚠️ **The project path must be pure ASCII.** A non-ASCII path makes OpenSSL's perl/nmake write into a mojibake directory and the build fails.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run desktop:dev
```

Test and build:

```bash
npm test
npm run desktop:build
```

## Create a workbench plugin

### Built-in plugin: Batch image rename

Open **Batch rename** in the main window and choose a root folder. This built-in plugin is enabled by default and can be disabled under **Settings → Plugins**. It scans images recursively, searches ancestor folder names up to the selected root, and stops at the first matching parent.

- `A/A1/A11/【1-1】A111/A1111/photo.jfif` becomes `0101_photo.jfif` with the default rule.
- Numeric captures are zero-padded (`1-1 → 0101`, `11-1 → 1101`) without truncating longer values.
- Use `(风景|人物)` with `{1}_{name}` for Chinese words, or `([A-Za-z]+)` with `{1}_{name}` for English words.
- `{1:initial}` keeps the first initial; `{1:initials}` turns `New York` into `NY`.
- Templates also support `{code}`, `{name}`, `{ext}`, `{folder}`, `{match}`, `{1}`, `{2}`, `{index}`, and `{index:03}`. Review the preview before applying; unmatched files and existing targets are reported and never overwritten. Modified patterns, templates, separators, and conversion settings can be saved as reusable custom rules or used to update an existing custom rule.

Plugins are no longer embedded with an `iframe`. The desktop app fetches HTML/CSS/JavaScript and mounts it in a trusted workbench runtime, avoiding `X-Frame-Options` failures and allowing a custom tab name. Install only code you trust.

A minimal plugin is a single HTML file:

```html
<!doctype html>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<main id="tool">
  <h1>My image tool</h1>
  <button id="ready">Done</button>
</main>
<script>
  document.querySelector("#ready").onclick = () => {
    window.PicLitePlugin.post("ready", { ok: true });
  };
</script>
```

Open Settings → Plugins to import `.html`, `.js`, or `manifest.json`, or enter a custom name and HTTPS URL for the desktop app to fetch. Manifest example:

```json
{
  "nameZh": "封面设计大师",
  "nameEn": "Banner Maker",
  "url": "https://example.com/plugin/"
}
```

See the full [plugin development guide](docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.en-US.md) for the runtime API, asset URL rules, and publishing notes.

## Privacy and licence

Optimisation runs locally in the browser or desktop app. Files leave your device only when you explicitly upload them to a storage provider you configured.

### Portable mode

Windows x64 and ARM64 portable ZIPs store settings and cache in `紫竹轻图-Data` beside the executable while `portable.txt` exists. WebView2 Runtime is required.
